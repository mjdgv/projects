**Description**

The core of this project lies in the creation of word N-grams and their utilization to implement auto-correction, auto-completion, and regular expression-like functionality for text manipulation. The project involves building word N-grams from a provided text corpus. N-grams are created to capture sequences of N words, allowing for context-aware text analysis. Using the generated N-grams, the system identifies and rectifies typographical errors, spelling mistakes, and grammatical inaccuracies in user-input text. It offers suggested corrections based on language patterns. Auto-completion functionality assists users by suggesting word completions. These suggestions are generated based on the input text and the context provided by N-grams, reducing user errors.
