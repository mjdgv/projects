**Description**

The N-Dimensional Minesweeper is an ambitious coding project designed to bring the classic Minesweeper game into the realm of higher dimensions. In this project, the conventional 2D grid used in traditional Minesweeper is extended to support N dimensions, where N can be any positive integer. The project incorporates game logic to ensure proper flagging of mines and the revelation of safe cells. It implements the essential gameplay elements needed to navigate the N-dimensional minesweeper grid.
