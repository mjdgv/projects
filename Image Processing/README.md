**Description**

This project allows users to transform and manipulate images by applying a wide range of filters. The filters include:
- Color manipulation: Convert colored images into greyscale images and vice versa.
- Blurring: Applies Gaussian blur to reduce image noise and reduce detail.
- Sharpening: Takes blurred image and reverses image into original state.
- Seam carving: Establishes a number of seams (paths of least importance) in an image and automatically removes seams to reduce image size without distorting proportions of objects in image.
- Filter Cascade: Applies series of filters specified by user to select image.
