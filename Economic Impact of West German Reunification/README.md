**Description**

In this project, I leveraged generative AI techniques for a comprehensive analysis of West Germany's economic trajectory in the context of reunification. The primary objective was to estimate what West Germany's GDP would have been if it had not undergone reunification with East Germany in 1990. This project was inspired by the paper _Comparative Politics and the Synthetic Control Method_ by Abadie, Diamond & Hainmueller (2015), which used synthetic control methods to estimate the economic impact of reunification. One major difference is that while they used a wide array of macroencomic indicators (industry share, investment rate, etc.), I focus primarily on GDP per capita. 

**Findings**

The results I got by creating a synthetic West Germany to estimate the economic cost of reunfication are in-line with the results acheived by Abadie, Diamond & Hainmueller, revealing that the reunification process came at a notable cost to West Germany. About four years after reunification, we begin to see Synthetic West Germany overtake West Germany in terms of GDP per capita. By 2003, Synthetic West Germany's GDP per capita is 2244 dollars higher than West Germnany's. Multiplying this difference times the number of people living in Germany in 2003 (82 million), we get that West Germany's GDP would have been 184 billion dollars higher in 2003 had it not reunified with East Germany.
